/*
 * Requirements:
 * Code simulates Conway's game of life from a starting shape. The user selects how 
 * many generations they want to simulate and it will run for that many generations. 
 * 
 * Design:
 * Start off with a grid of size 20 x 20 and start with a basic glider. Use a for loop to
 * iterate through each square to check if in the next generation if the square has an alive or 
 * a dead actor in it. Store these values in an array and then implement these arrays in the grid
 * once you have iterated through every square.
 * 
 * Reflection:
 * I liked this lab but couldn't figure out how to do it until we had learned arrays. I probably
 * missed an easier way to do it but overall, I found it quite challenging and entertaining.
 * I was surprised at how difficult it was to figure out the logic because you needed to iterate 
 * through all of the squares before adding or removing any rocks. I would like to know how you do 
 * it without using arrays.
